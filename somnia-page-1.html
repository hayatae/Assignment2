    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Musings from Route 914, in the PA woods</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;"><small>by me</small></h3>
    <br>
 
    <p>Keep your eyes on the road.</p>
    <p>Let your eyes follow the yellow and white lines, because they're the last important things but the most necessary. Essential</p>
    <p>The road is winding and hilly and dark, hills and woods and mountains and forest. The road isn't safe, so keep your speed down. Fifteen miles an hour in the switchback, all the way up to forty on teh straightaways. But don't turn on your high beams.</p>
    <p><small>Do places gain reputations because of the ambiance they have, or does the ambiance generate the reputation?</small></p>
    <p>Ignore the movement from the corner of your eyes; you have children sleeping in the backseat. They're exhausted and happy and it is a blessing they're asleep, because they would mention the shadow that looks like a deer with antlers of branches. They would ask about the eyes between the trees. They would be excited about the unlikely foxfire-green light flickering in the cracks of boulders, dying and appearing again in a mocking dance alongside your car as you drive. They would ask about the sounds that come through the barely cracked open windows, the growls and echoing huffing that always seems to be just below the driver's side door.</p>
    <p>You don't hear it. You don't hear it on purpose, and you won't turn your head for any reason. <i>(You've already mastered the art of flicking your eyes away before your mind can comprehend what you may have seen. At least, you tell yourself you have.)</i></p>
    <p>Watch the road. Try to remember where it started, when your pulse started rising into your throat and the hair on the back of your arms crawled up in a forever-long shiver. Where your palms grew clammy and it became hard to breathe. When the first glance at the side of the road <i>(there wasn't an arm reaching out from under that pallet, something too thin and too long and the color of old, dead moss, there wasn't)</i> made your brain stutter and the rational part of your thoughts shut down. Focus on the road.</p>
    <p>Keep something in the passenger seat. A purse, a suitcase, a box, leftover fast-food trash. An empty seat is an invitation. Everyone knows that, even if they've never been told. <i>(A small part of you is deeply thankful the kids are in their seats in the back even though you can't shake the guilt for that feeling.)</i> You realize that you always kept random things in the car not because it was hard to clean up, but because it meant there was always something to fill the seats. Don't look at the shapes at the edge of the woods that are humanoid and headed your way; there are no seats in your car for anyone <i>(anything)</i> else.</p>
    <p">That was a reflector at the side of the road, tacked haphazardly to a fallen mailbox. There was only one of them, not two. They did not blink at you. They did not narrow and still be in your rearview mirror. You didn't see that. Convince yourself fast, because there's another turn just ahead and you need to be clear minded.</p>
    <p>Hit the brakes to avoid another opossum and breathe a sigh. (Keep your eyes on the road. Don't watch it run into the underbrush - it will not be alone.) Your fingers shake on the steering wheel as you accelerate again. Be wary. They use the wildlife to their advantage. <i>(Just over the next hill make a split-second choice - do you swerve to avoid the thing in the road that resembles nothing natural? Or do you pretend desperately that you don't see and risk the impact?)</i></p>
    <p>Be as careful as you can. Watch the lines. Don't turn on your high beams, no matter how other drivers try to convince you. Avoid looking at the woods. And the fields. And even the houses nestled at the edge of the trees. <i>(Do you look behind you to check on the kids? Please let them be the only thing you see in the mirrors when you do.)</i> Breathe.</p>
    <p>The rustlings followed you farther than you thought. You know that this intersection was safe before; it was safe last night at least. The wind is going the wrong direction for those leaf shadows, for the cloud movement. Don't pay attention. Wipe your hands on your pants - the steering wheel is getting too slippery.</p>
    <p>Pray you've been convincing.</p>
    <p>Most of it goes away as the lights of civilization draw closer - except for the feeling between your shoulder blades, that almost-itch that means something is looking at you. <i>(Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back.)</i></p>    <p>Pull in. The kids are still asleep. Get out of the car and look over the lake.</p>
    <p>The mist over the lake is mostly opaque. The moonlight shines through and makes the weight of it feel like opal and reflects on the lake. It's beautiful.</p>
    <p>Get the kids into the tent one at a time, nestled under blankets on the same mattress. Turn off the car. Take a breath.</p>
    <p>That feeling between your shoulders grows.</p>
    <p>Something in the mists shifts, far out on the water. There's a ripple in the glassy surface, pushing to the shore from the movement above the water.</p>
    <p>Step back. Enter and zip the tent quickly. Get into the bed, shoes off but jacket on and contacts in and keys still in your pocket. You gather the children close. <i>(They haven't woken through all this and your harsh breathing doesn't even cause them to stir, they're so young and so worn out and sleep-cuddly warm.)</i></p>
    <p>Don't sleep.</p>
    <p>Keep your eyes on the road. Don't turn on the high beams. Ignore the shadows playing over the tent walls. It's just lights from other campers. Don't leave empty seats in the car. Pretend you didn't see. Pretend you can't feel the crawly feeling on your skin. Pretend hard.</p>
    <p>Don't sleep.</p>
    <p>Don't sleep.</p>
